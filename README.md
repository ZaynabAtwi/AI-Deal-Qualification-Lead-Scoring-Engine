AI-Driven Lead Qualification & Deal Scoring for Real Estate CRMs

--------------------
## Executive Summary
Real estate agencies do not suffer from a lack of leads.
They suffer from a lack of clarity.

Inbound requests from WhatsApp, Instagram, forms, and calls overwhelm agents, while only a small fraction of leads ever convert into closed deals. Traditional CRMs store data but do not think, do not prioritize, and do not protect agents’ time.

This project introduces an AI Lead Intelligence Agent that sits on top of any CRM and performs what a senior sales manager does manually:
qualify, score, prioritize, and recommend action for every incoming lead.

------------------
## The Problem This Solves
Most real estate CRMs fail at answering the questions that actually matter:

* Which leads deserve immediate attention?

* Which leads are wasting agent time?

* Which inquiries have real deal potential?

* Where is the budget–location mismatch?

* When should a human intervene?

**As a result:**

* Agents chase low-intent leads

* Serious buyers wait too long

* Conversion rates drop

* Operational costs rise

This project addresses that gap directly.
